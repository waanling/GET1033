IDEA 1: fireblending, punching 
input: accelerator
output: gas, lighter -- fire 

IDEA 2: icecream delivery 
input: 
heat (when the temperature in SG is above 33 degrees, the sensor will trigger the computer to produce icecream)
weight sensor to detect if there is icecream

output: icecream 

IDEA 3: Automatic foot massager 
input: accelerator, tilt sensor
if the slipper is in a vertical position, motors will turn on to vibrate and massage the feet 
if the slipper is in a horizontal position, the motors will turn off. 

physical parts: 
socks

2 x Arduino Lilypad Main Board 
2 x Lilypad Accelerometer Boards 
2 x Lilypad Power boards 
2 x Lilypad Vibe Boards 
2 x Lithium Ion Polymer batteries 

output: 
motion - vibration in order to massage the feet 

to complicate things further: 
moisture sensor - if the slipper's moisture level is above a certain threshold, the motors will keep vibrating/or the slipper will light up in order to indicate that the slipper should be washed 

input
how is it stored in the computer program (if this then this, then that)
how to translate into the actual output
